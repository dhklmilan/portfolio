                             Community forestry is all about people and their forests—working together to care for the land while ensuring it meets their needs. Since starting my Bachelor of Science in Forestry, I’ve been diving into this field, from trekking through forests to collect data to sitting down with communities to draft operational plans and constitutions.
             
                            Honestly, the best part of this work has been connecting with people in so many different places. I spent a month in Khotang district, where I saw how locals manage their forests. Then there was Okhaldhunga and Solukhumbu—mountain regions, where village has its own way of working with the forested land.
             
                             Down in the lower regions, places like Makawanpur, Bara, and Chitwan taught me something entirely different. Here, I got involved in both traditional community forestry and scientific approaches. It’s fascinating to see how these two methods can come together to address real challenges.
             
                            These days, I’m working on creating operational plans for forests in central Nepal, especially in Chitwan and Nawalpur.
             
                             In Nepal, community forestry isn’t just a program—it’s a way of life. When forests are managed this way, they’re not just resources—they’re part of the community, part of the future.

                            <p> I had the privilege of participating in an agricultural internship, known as the Learning and Earning Program, at the Ramat Negev International Training Center in Israel’s South District. This 11-month program was a unique blend of hands-on learning and practical work experience.
                                My focus was in plant science, where I collaborated with individuals from diverse nations, each contributing their own ideologies, perspectives, and cultural backgrounds.
                               Beyond the professional experience, immersing myself in Israel’s rich history and vibrant culture added a profound layer of personal growth.
                               The program provided me with valuable knowledge in plant science, teamwork, and the ability to adapt to cross-cultural environments through effective communication.
                               Although my time at Ramat Negev was cut short due to unforeseen circumstances, the experience left a lasting impact, equipping me with skills and insights that continue to
                                shape my approach to plant science and collaborative work.</p>

                            <p>
                                I completed a six-month research internship at the Forest Research and Training Centre in Kathmandu, Nepal. This experience provided me with valuable experience in a range of areas, including:

                        <div>• Developing allometric equations for seven major species, encompassing fieldwork, lab work, data entry, and data cleansing. </div>
                        <div>• Assessing bamboo resources outside forest areas using visual image interpretation via Collect Earth Online (CEO), conducting laboratory work for biomass modeling, and implementing Quality Assurance and Quality Control (QA/QC) processes.</div>
                        <div> • Conducting LiDAR-based scanning field surveys in western Nepal.</div>
                        <div> • Applying research methodologies for forest research and data analytics.</div>

                               <p> During my internship, I focused specifically on forest fire risk modeling in the Chure Terai Madhesh Landscape (CTML),
                                a vulnerable area in Nepal. This work gave me valuable insights into forest fire research and allowed me to contribute to understanding 
                                and mitigating forest fire risks. I also collaborated with a team of experts, gathering their input and analyzing data related to forest fire incidents, 
                                climate patterns, vegetation types, and other environmental factors. I primarily focused my internship on using advanced statistical and geographic information system (GIS)
                                 tools to develop accurate forest fire risk models. Through this experience, I gained valuable skills in data analysis, GIS applications, research methodologies, and 
                                 collaborating effectively with various stakeholders.

                                I had the privilege of being part of a soil survey and sampling project for  
                                    Digital Soil Mapping in the Makawanpur district, Nepal, as a field crew member.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This initiative was led by the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) in collaboration with the National Soil Science Research Center (NSSRC) under Nepal Agricultural Research Council (NARC). The field work involved soil sample collection, classification, and analysis, focusing on both physical and chemical properties. On the physical side, characteristics like horizons, depth, boundaries, color, texture, structure, and porosity were observed. For chemical analysis, soil pH and organic matter content were observed in field (pit).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                What made this project particularly interesting was exploring how soil types varied across Nepal’s distinct physiographic zones, from the Terai and Chure to the Mid-hills. In total, soil samples were collected from 56 districts, covering all seven provinces of Nepal. These samples were then combined with environmental covariates—data derived from satellite imagery—to provide a more comprehensive picture. Later, for spatial predictions of soil properties at a resolution of 250 meters
                            machine learning algorithms were used. 
                            <p>
                                The results of this project were hosted on a digital platform by NARC, creating a national soil information system for Nepal. This system is designed to be periodically updated, ensuring it remains a valuable resource for both local and provincial stakeholders. Beyond the technical achievements, this effort has raised awareness about soil management and its importance at all levels.
